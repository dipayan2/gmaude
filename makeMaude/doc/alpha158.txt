Alpha 158 release notes
========================

Bug fixes
==========

(1) A bug where the LaTeX for op names in op declarations, renaming and views
did not use math italic for single character names like f and regular italic
for simple multi-character names like infinity. Reported by Paco.

(2) A bug where the strategy part of an srewrite command was not printed in the
LaTeX comment.

(3) A bug where show desugared did not show overloaded declarations for
imported operators. Illustrated by:

fmod TEST is
  sort ExtBool .
  subsort Bool < ExtBool .
  op _or_ : ExtBool ExtBool -> ExtBool [ditto] .
endfm

show desugared .

This bug also affected the LaTeX output.

(4) A bug where color generated by a format attribute could run into
the text following a term in LaTeX output:

mod FOO is
  op a b : -> Bool [format (r d d)] .
endm

set print format on .

search a b =>* X:Bool such that a b .

(5) A bug where generating a newline using a format attribute reset the color
to black in the LaTeX output (this is a LaTeX feature). Illustrated by:

mod FOO is
  op a b : -> Bool [format (r n o)] .
endm

set print format on .

search a b =>* X:Bool such that a b .

Other changes
==============

(1) Comments at the start of each command in latex output no longer use
\begin{comment} ... \end{comment} to avoid Paco's pathological case.
Instead just % is used and the printing of user's formatting attributes which
could included a newline is suppressed.

(2) Changed the LaTeX spacing of show commands so that the command is closer
to its result than it is to the previous result.
