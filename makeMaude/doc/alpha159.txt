Alpha 159 release notes
========================

Bug fix
========

A bug where generating a newline in the output of loop mode reset the color
to black in the LaTeX output. Illustrated by:

mod FOO is
  inc LOOP-MODE .
  op s : -> State .
  op start : -> System .
  rl start => [nil, s, 'foo '\r 'bar '\n 'baz] .
endm

loop start .

New feature
============

There is a print option
  set print latex on/off .
that controls whether latex attributes are used for generating
latex for terms. Default is on. Requested by Paco.
