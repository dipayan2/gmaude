Alpha 162 release notes
========================

Bug fix
========
A typo where /\ was used rather tha \/ for outputting disjuctions
of states in text (but LaTeX was correct). Spotted by Jose.

New feature
============
vu-narrow has an option vfold, which is like fold but uses variant
subsumption rather than matching to decide if one state is more
general than another:

mod BAZ is
  sort Foo .
  ops f g h : Foo -> Foo .
  ops i j k : Foo Foo -> Foo .

vars X Y Z W A B C D : Foo .
  eq j(f(X), Y) = i(f(Y), X) [variant] .
  rl g(i(X, k(Y, Z))) => f(k(Z, X)) [narrowing] .
  rl f(k(X, X)) => h(X) [narrowing] .
endm

{path,vfold} vu-narrow {filter,delay} in BAZ : g(j(A, B)) =>* C .
show most general states .

I'm curious what effect it has on more complex examples. On all the
examples I have to hand, the set of most general states is the same.
