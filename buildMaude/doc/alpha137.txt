Alpha 137 release notes
========================

Bug fixes
==========
(1) A bug in the Yices bindings where constraints were being asserted twice.

(2) A bug in the prelude where projection functions didn't work for
parameterized meta-modules - found and fixed by Rubén.

(3) A bug in the handling of extension information for iter symbols; illustrated
by this example from Rubén:

mod UNINITIALIZED-BUG is
  protecting NAT .
  vars N M : Nat .
  crl [rwc] : s N => M if N => M [nonexec] .
endm

srew 3 using rwc{idle} .

Here two solutions are produced but only one is valid.

(4) A bug in loop mode where it would try to continue using state left
over from some incompatible command. Reported by Rubén and provoked by:

search 0 =>* 0 .
(restart loop mode)


Other changes
==============
(1) std::mt19937 is used instead of having 3rdParty/MersenneTwister.h in
the source tree.
