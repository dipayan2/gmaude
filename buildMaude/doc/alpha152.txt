Alpha 152 release notes
========================

Bug fixes
==========

(1) A bug where view instantiations did not have their arguments correctly typeset
in LaTeX; for example:

fmod TEST{X :: TRIV} is
  inc SET{List{X}} .
endfm

show desugared .

Here X should be typeset in the parameter font inside SET{List{X}} and the
square brackets that are used to distiguish parameter X from a potential view
X should not appear (because parameter X occludes any similarly named view).

(2) A bug where the LaTeX generated for the one strategy contained an extra
open parenthesis. Reported by Rubén and illustrated by:

srew 0 using one(idle) .

(3) A bug where the LaTeX generated for the srewrite and dsrewrite command
with a bound contained an extra numeric argument inside the brackets.
Reported by Rubén and illustrated by:

srew [4] 0 using fail .
dsrew [4] 0 using fail .

(4) A bug where filtered variant unfication did not terminate, because
of runaway variant generation in the subsumption computation.
Illustrated by this bug report from UberPyro:

(5) A compile time error on 32-bit targets, reported by rljacobson:

New features
=============

(1) Additional commands have LaTeX support:
(a) show modules
(b) show views
(c) match/xmatch
(d) unify/irredundant unify
(e) variant unify/filtered variant unify
(f) variant match
(g) get variants/get irredundant variants
(f) parse

Other changes
==============

(1) LaTeX support for the show sorts command now uses the tabto package rather
than the longtable package. This has the advantage that long lines now wrap
rather than get trucated but unfortunately the hangindent paragraphs that
are normally used for continuation lines have to be disabled to avoid confusing
this package, so wrapped lines generated by this command start at the beginning
of a new line rather than being indented.

(2) Various low level optimizations to the semi-compilation of free theory
patterns in equations. This is only really noticeable on very large examples.
Requested by Dwight Guth <dwight.guth@runtimeverification.com>.

(3) The config.guess file has been updated in the hope of resolving a build
issue on 64-bit RISC-V reported by moui0:
