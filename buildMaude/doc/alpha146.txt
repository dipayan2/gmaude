Alpha 146 release notes
========================

Changes
========

(1) Commands that end in "on ." or "off ." are now overparsed for in case
the space is missing; i.e.
  set trace on.

(2) Optimizations to AC/ACU matching/rewriting against an example provided by Paco:
(i) When merging two argument lists under an AC/ACU function symbol, e.g. if normalizing
f(t, t'), where t, t' are headed by f, the resulting argument list is considered for
conversion to a red-black tree even if one or both of the original argument lists were not
red-black trees.
(ii) Fast paths based on uniform sort criteria for the collector part of the stripper-collector
matching algorithm and the AC/ACU matching subproblem one variable case.
(iii) Allow the collector part of the stripper-collector to convert sufficient large argument
lists to a red-black tree.
(iv) A new AC/ACU subproblem class for red-black trees when unmatched part consists of a
stripper variable, a collector variable and all solutions required. This gives the largest
speed up for Paco's example.

(3) Optimizations for token handling.

(4) Linux version is now built to run on pre-Haswell processors.
