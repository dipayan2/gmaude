Alpha 145 release notes
========================

Bug fix
========

A bug where internal error and stack overflow messages were being
lost on Macs. This seems to be due to stripped binaries so the Mac binary
is no longer stripped.

Other changes
==============

(1) Overparsing for prec/gather/format/strat/strategy/poly attributes
without their needed information in operator declarations. For example:

fmod FOO is
  op _+_ : Bool Bool -> Bool [prec gather format strat strategy poly] .
endfm


(2) Overparsing for prec/gather/format attributes without their needed
information in operator mappings. For example:

fmod FOO is
  inc NAT * (op _+_ to _++_ [format prec gather]) .
endfm
